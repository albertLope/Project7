    /*
        Create a method name is transferOtherUser
        Parameters are 2 objects of Users class(Users  sendingUser , Users receivingUser )and one int (transferAmount)
        Return type is String

        if the transferAmount is greater  than amountAccount1 variable of the object sendingUser
        Then return Sender is poor lol :)

       if the transferAmount is smaller than amountAccount1 variable of the object sendingUser
            Remove 2 percent from the transferAmount
            remove the transferAmount from the sendingUser amountAccount1( you need to use withDraw method)
            add the transferAmount to the receivingUser  amountAccount1 (you need to use deposit method)
        Then return "Transaction is completed successfully"

        For example:
        SendingUser amountAccount1 has 1000 dollar
        receiving user amountAccount1 has 200 dollar

        transferAmount 100
        After the transaction SendingUser amountAccount1 should have 902 dollor
        After the transaction receivingUser amountAccount1 should have 298 dollor
